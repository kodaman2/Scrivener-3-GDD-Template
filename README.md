# Scrivener 3 GDD Template
Game Design Document for Scrivener

Was made with macOS version of Scrivener 3. No idea if works under Windows sorry.

Zip archive is the actual template which you import from the new project template window.

PNG is a reference file if you want to create a new icon.

This template is a direct copy from:
